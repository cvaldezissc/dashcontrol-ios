# DashControl

## Requirements

DashControl uses both [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) and [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) to manage dependencies. To install them run in the command line:
- `gem install cocoapods` or  `sudo gem install cocoapods` (if first command fails)
- `brew update && brew install carthage`

To get started with the DashControl run the following commands after every "git pull":
- `pod install`
- `carthage bootstrap`

Use **DashControl.xcworkspace** to open the project.
